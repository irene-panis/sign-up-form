This is a simple sign-up form modeled after the 100 Thieves website; it's purely frontend as I still haven't learned much about the backend yet. This
project was kind of meant to be a sequel of sorts to the 100 Thieves landing page I created as esports is one of my big interests and I can't help but
model several of my projects after it.

Not only did this small project allow me to get my hands dirty with basic form creation and form validation, but it also helped me refresh my memory
on flexbox and DOM manipulation as I've been out of practice for a few months.

The form makes use of event listeners to check if the "password" and "confirm password" inputs match, and restricts the user from submitting the form
if the email or password inputs are invalid.

Later down the line I'd like to polish the flexbox/styling; I did as best as I could to make it look alright but I wouldn't be surprised if the page
still looks a little wonky on certain screen sizes.
